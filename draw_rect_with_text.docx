1.	Draw a rectangle and write text inside it (using Turtle & Image Draw modules)
Analyzed the module ImageDraw module : 
The ImageDraw module provides simple 2D graphics for Image objects. Using below code, the TB diagram is aimed to construct on a .jpg file. Since it is easy to draw shapes/arrows in image file, “Image draw module” has been chosen. In the below script,
•	Created an empty image *.jpg file
o	img = Image.new("RGB", (500, 500),"white") 
•	Drew a rectangle in that image using “ImageDraw” module
•	Saved the image & using the Image Draw module, inserted the text inside the rectangle (by changing the required dimensions in trial and error manner)
o	Img1.rectangle(), img1.text() methods
•	Added that .jpg file into a .docx document & saved that. (using docx module)
Analyzed & tried with turtle 
•	doc.add_picture()

============================================================================================================
Using ImageDraw Module :

#This “docx” module is to manipulate with docs like MS Word. Used it to add picture to the document
import docx
#This “pillow” module to import Image draw module
from PIL import Image,ImageDraw
#Taking the handle “doc” for docx
doc = docx.Document()
#Opening an image of .jpg or .png with 500 * 500 dimension
img = Image.new("RGB", (500, 500),"white") 
# create an image draw handle
img1 = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
#Drawing a rectangle using Imagedraw module with below dimensions on that already created image 
img1.rectangle((200,125,300,200),fill ="orange", outline = "black",width = 1)
#Added the text to that rectangle using text() method
img1.text((210, 150), "CHECK TEXT", fill = "black",align = "center")
#This will display that image
img.show()
#Choose the file path accordingly to store that image
img.save('C:\\Users\\path \\line.jpg');
#This is to open a MS Word document and add an image on it.
doc.add_picture('C:\\path \\line.jpg');
doc.save('C:\\path\\filename.jpg);



Using Turtle :

•	“Turtle” is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes 
•	Created rectangle by traversing via directions and inserted text  inside the rectangle
#Choosing the “TURTLE” library
from turtle import *
# Choose Color for rectangle
color("orange")
# Enabling fill to color the shape
begin_fill()
# Traverse in directions, to draw rectangle
#Move forward direction of 300 units (length of rectangle)
forward(300);
#Turn the pointer to right direction(like at 90 degree)
right(90)
#Move forward 150 units after turning right (breadth of rect)
forward(150)
#Turn the pointer to right direction(like at 90 degree)
right(90)
#Move forward 300 units after turning right (length of rect)
forward(300);
#Turn the pointer to right direction(like at 90 degree)
right(90)
#Move forward 150 units after turning right (breadth of rect)
forward(150)
#Turn the pointer to right direction(like at 90 degree)
right(90)
# End the coloring inside that rectangle
end_fill()
#Choose color to write inside rectangle
color("BLACK") # Choose Black color to write
#Enabling the text fill color
begin_fill()
#This penup feature is to enable the pointer
penup()
#Fixing the pointer location from where to start the text inside rectangle
forward (150)
#To make the text inside the rectangle (not above the rectangle)
left(65)
backward (20)
#Write the desired text that needs to be written onto the rectangle
write("TEXT INSIDE RECTANGLE USING TURTLE", True, align="center")
